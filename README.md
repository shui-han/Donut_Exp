# Donut_Exp
Here is an example of the donut task. 

There are three main phases. 
1. A baseline binocular rivalry dominance tracking task, where you will be asked to indicate the dominant orientation (pull and hold the specified trigger for a given orientation, so that we can collect the duration of the percept's dominance).

2. A donut phase where you will be presented with a flashing donut and a central dot. Here, you will asked to indicate whenever the dot turns yellow. As the colour changes can be rapid, pull and release ONCE whenever the dot turns Yellow.

3. A repeat of the binocular rivalry task.

I've originally tried to make this a standalone app, so you'll be presented with all the practice and experimental trials in consecutive order.
Missing are controls and follow-ups which I want to conduct but will add on a later date. 

Heads-up:  I've tried to include longer inter-trial intervals, but the experiment can still be very tiring.
